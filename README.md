## **Description**
##### This development was done with React. The application simulates a social network registration, allowing users to create an account, log in, and view their dashboard.

##### The main objective is to practice what was learned during Week 4 of the Kenzie course. It utilizes libraries like styled-components, axios, react-icons, react-hook-form, react-router-dom, react-toastify, and zod. 
##### After logging in and accessing the Dashboard page, users can create a Card detailing the technology they know and their level of expertise in it. Once the card is created, users can also edit it to change the level of knowledge or delete it if they wish.
